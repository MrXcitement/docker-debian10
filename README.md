# Docker Debian Base Image
A Debian 9 base image to be used as a starting point for other images.

## Overview
This project uses a Dockerfile and Makefile to manage the creation and
distribution of a base Debian docker image.  One novel aspect of the Makefile
is the use of touch to create files for the non-file targets docker-build and
docker-push.

## Usage
To build the image

```
$ make docker-build
```

To push the built image

```
$ make docker-push
```

To login to docker hub

```
$ make docker-login
```

To run the image

```
$ make docker-run
```
